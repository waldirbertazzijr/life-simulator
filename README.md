# Life Simulator
Life simulator is a simple JS + HTML Canvas experiment.

I tried to build a simple abstract structure of the nature with:

- Trees: grows gradually, static.
- Herbivores: seek and eat trees.
- Carnivores: seet and eat herbivores.


## How to run
Open index.html on the browser of your choice.
